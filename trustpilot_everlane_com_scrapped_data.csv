68b965d0f68085bf019325d1,Bad Experience with an Eventual Resolution.,"*** UPDATE: *** I am updating my review as I have been contacted shortly after this review was posted and they issued a full refund for the undelivered items. I have updated my rating from 1 to 3 stars to reflect this resolution. The most unsettling part of this experience, and a serious warning for others, was that my entire order disappeared from my account history while I was trying to get help. This is not a small glitch, it’s a critical failure that makes you suspect fraud, as if the company is erasing the record of your purchase. The company cited a website migration as the cause, but the result for the customer is a complete breakdown of trust. While I'm glad the financial aspect is settled, the overall experience wasn't great. -------------------------------------------------------------- *** INITIAL REVIEW: *** Be very wary of ordering from Everlane. My order (r546456625) arrived with only 1 out of the 3 items I paid for. I immediately contacted Customer Support and was told they were ""looking into it."" I never heard from them again. To make matters worse, the entire order has now been removed from my order history on their website. They took my money for three items, sent one, and are now acting like the purchase never happened. This feels like a complete scam. Very unhappy customer over here!!!",3,2025-09-04 12:11:28+00:00,en,,Mr.R,RO,,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency
68aebe6de7252cdc5f17f652,My experience with Everlane has been…,"My experience with Everlane has been the worst I’ve ever had with an online store. They suddenly put my account “on hold” and canceled my order without telling me! Just imagine how serious that is... I had to ask “what happened?” before they had the “decency” to “explain.” Even though, the sizes I purchased were still in stock, once my account was frozen those sizes disappeared extremely fast and I could no longer buy them. Really strange, right? Their excuse? They claimed there were “multiple accounts with the same billing information.” Later, Everlane themselves forced me to create a second account: new email, new credit card, and new billing address, just to complete my purchase, and then punished me for it again. They humiliated me and did the worst a company can do: they wasted my time and gave me nothing in return. Because of their arbitrary decision, I lost an entire day dealing with this situation, suffering severe stress, anxiety, and frustration while my order was canceled multiple times without reason. Instead of verifying my identity or solving the issue, they blocked me completely, refused to remove the hold, and even refused to delete my data. I no longer trust them and don’t want to have anything to do with a company that still keeps my personal information against my will and especially after what they did to me. Everlane creates its own problems, blames the customer, and causes unnecessary stress. They treat shoppers with suspicion, deny access without due process, and refuse to respect data privacy. I strongly advise against trusting this company with your money or your personal information. They don’t even know how to properly use a security system or verify the facts before punishing their customers.",1,2025-08-27 10:14:37+00:00,en,,Margo,US,,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency

This is incredibly stressful as it is not a cheap brand. And customer service has been abysmal. I would not recommend ordering from Everlane for this reason!

682f9926edc15446d79bd6b4,Terrible quality,"Absolutely terrible products. I have a tote bag that I change out with many other bags, so it hasn't been used more than a few months in total, and the handle is so badly worn it's about to snap. The rest of the bag is in good shape, but that doesn't really matter once the strap snaps and I can no longer use it. Of course it's out of the return/refund timeframe and they basically said ""too bad."" These bags are fairly expensive for such poor quality. Buyer beware. Edit: I was not expecting a refund or replacement. I sent photos of the bag which is in good condition. It's very obviously a bag that was not carried a lot. However, one strap is shredded, falling apart, and is about to snap. There should be an option to have this fixed. This bag has only been used a total of about 3 months. I have bags I've owned for 30 years and have been used much more that look like new. These Everlane bags are garbage and way too expensive to wear out like this.

68276e228e644670d81b3e24,Leather loafers: wear and tear after in few months of careful wearing ?!,"In May 2024 I’ve ordered a pair of black modern loafer I’ve men having on my wishlist for years for they came at a price of 160EUR (+import taxes for orders from USA). Since I really wanted them for a long time I was thrilled to open a package and find them to be exactly as perfect as I imagined. I wore them seldom, mostly in office or indoors generally. Seldom outdoors and even then on some short walks like meeting my girlfriend for downtown coffee (and taking a cab to get there and back). In past year, I’ve also spent 4 months on sabbatical in my small hometown and didn’t pack the loafers with me for I find them to precious to ware them there. You can thank imagine my shock when yesterday, May 15 2025 I found a whole in them, on the the side where leather is sewed into the sole of the shoe (!!!). When I contacted to express my utter shock, and attached photos (including the one of my foot to illustrate that I do t have deformed toe that might have pierced out) replay was : it’s an ware and tears issues.

6800b2a53a5d7b911838a9ae,Disappointing Durability: My Experience with the Everlane Felted Merino Half-Zip Sweater,"I purchased the Everlane Felted Merino Half-Zip Sweater on November 30th, 2024, during a sale for €116 (approximately $131.76). The original price at the time was €194. While the initial feel of the 100% merino wool was pleasant and completely itch-free, and the fit was excellent, the quality has been significantly disappointing, especially considering the price point, even with the discount. Despite wearing the sweater only 2-3 days a week for roughly 4-6 hours at a time and being careful to avoid any activities that could damage the fabric (such as physical exertion or gardening), noticeable pilling began to appear around mid-December. I took extra precautions to minimize friction against other clothing, yet the entire body of the sweater is now extensively covered in pills. Based on this first experience with Everlane, I cannot personally recommend this brand. For anyone considering purchasing this sweater or other Everlane items, I strongly advise you to reconsider and conduct thorough research beforehand. This experience has highlighted a significant issue with the durability of this particular garment and may save you from a similar disappointment. --- EDIT --- Following this review, Everlane's customer support promptly contacted me to address my concerns. After I provided photos of the pilling, they offered a full refund for the sweater, and I was even able to keep the garment. I appreciate their willingness to take responsibility and provide a satisfactory resolution in this manner. While my initial experience with the sweater's quality was disappointing, their customer service response was commendable.",3,2025-04-17 09:49:57+00:00,en,,Aymé ,FR,,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency

67e16dfd98b3401f76fe2ac3,Edited//Good customer service,"Edited: Very nice, fast & helpful customer service! I ordered a jeans on sale and got a product that already had signs of usage on the denim at the pockets and the bottom of the pant legs - like the jeans had already been worn for a few years (very thin, worn and ripped denim...and it wasn't actually supposed to be that type of style). I accepted this initially because I was told ""no returns on final sale"" but then after only one day of usage, the jeans ripped apart on day 2 - right at the crtch, a tear about 8 cm long (I was just walking around in my kitchen when it happened, not exactly doing the splits or the like). I'm really disappointed and sad because the jeans were actually a great fit, if a bit loose (but I preferred that) but the material was so poor. It doesn't matter that it's a sale, please don't sell sub-standard goods.

I was home all day and get a text from the delivery driver that he was unable to gain access to my building and would have to come back… had he texted me prior to leaving, I could have simply opened the door.

I saw there was a sale on May 26th so I placed an order . On May 31st I received an email that the order had ""shipped"" but on June 4th the order was in the same status and detailed tracking showed that only the shipping label had been created. I contacted Everlane and the rep tried to tell me that it was in transit but there's an error with DHL tracking and that she couldn't do anything but if I didn't receive the order by the 21st of June to reach out. I told her that wasn't acceptable and she gave me another excuse about extended international shipping times to some regions - the parcel is traveling from Ohio to central London. I check back yesterday and suddenly the tracking has been updated and to my surprise DHL had just received the parcel. Estimated arrival date is 12 June.

Days later, I did not see any delivery but received an email that my package arrived.

Their initial reply to me was to check a long list of possible shippers they use???? A few days later I again emailed the company to let them know I did not receive the item. It took multiple emails to learn that the shipper was DHL. They insisted that the item was delivered and I requested proof of delivery, because it may have been delivered to a neighbor. They suggested that I check around the neighborhood. I said a proof of the delivery would be better. Finally, I requested a refund which was provided 9 days after my order. 13 days after the order, the package was delivered. I told them they can resell this shirt to me for a discount of 40%. This discount I requested was because while I was waiting for the shirt to arrive, it went on sale for 25% off, plus my first order discount of 15% should also be honored.

Their clothing is cut well and usually has nice details. It is not cheap because it is well made and built to last. I was VERY surprised to see they had such a low rating. One of the other reasons I never hesitate to shop with Everlane is that although I live in Canada, they have made it easy and efficient to do returns. I was surprised to see they have such a low rating. It is far more difficult for me to return Amazon purchases! Once a box is delivered (always quickly) if there is an item I wish to return, I bring up my order online and press ‘Start Return’, my full order is presented and I tick the box next to whatever I wish to return (only some deeply discounted items are final purchase but they are clearly marked in red) ￼ Once my items are chosen to return, I am immediately issued a label to print. Part goes inside the box, part is the exterior label and I wrap it up and take my parcel to the local Post Office who issue a receipt. That is all there is to it. I have always been refunded in a timely manner. I find the quality, for the price, to be exceptionally good at Everlane. Once I figured out my size which took a little bit of back and forth, it has become very easy for me to now know exactly what will fit me well etc.. The only thing that makes sense to me is that perhaps they used to be difficult to deal with but have, in 2023, improved greatly. I can think of no other retailer, that does not have a brick & mortar store, that is as easy to purchase and return to.

650db9a15a59f0bfb0f41a3f,Awful Quality and Service,"Awful quality. Awful customer service. Product was of terrible quality - cheap material poorly constructed. The garment sizing was 1/2"" over what was at the top end of the guide, which I was told was 'acceptable industry tolerances' (conveniently set at 1/2"") and as such would not qualify for a free return postage. As someone not in the clothes making or selling industry, I do feel this is questionable to pass this on. More so that at no point in the selling of the garment that I was made aware this rule applied and would be a determining factor in the returns process. Utter dross. Update. After much back-and-forth they provided free returns shipping. The comments about the clear lack of quality control in their products, and their acceptance of this poor quality, still stand. They offered a 20% discount on future purchases in response to this review.

I ordered a pair of Everlane Super Soft Relaxed Jeans in light vintage blue. What arrived was a pair of high rise skinny jeans in dark blue. What was even more bizarre was that the labelling, belonging to the Super Soft Relaxed Jeans, had clearly been ripped from the Super Soft Relaxed Jeans, and stuffed in the back pocket of the high rise skinnies to make it look as if these were the correct jeans. Everlane did very quickly and efficiently sort the issue out, giving me a full refund and allowing me to keep the jeans. I don't know what had gone wrong on the supply end, but it was dealt with and managed. 3 stars- 1 star for the wrong item and the strange label which looked as if it had been ripped from another pair of jeans, and 2 stars for the management of the issue.

63fe5c8e9b64b1bdaf655726,Same-Sized Items are Inconsistent. Return Shipping Costs $7. Mediocre clothes & experience.,"Edit 2: I took another risk and ordered another one of their pants that was FINAL SALE. I followed their size chart and even read the reviews. For size 2, the pants were gigantic and the waist was inches bigger than their size chart stated. This is the second time I had to donate pants from Everlane due to poor sizing. Avoid their final sale items because their sizing is all over the place! Edit: Everlane asked for more info which lead to Trustpilot giving me a time limit to respond otherwise they will delete my review. So I gave them my order info. If you see bad reviews here randomly disappeared, it's because people either forgot or don't have time to respond within a few days with asked info. I ordered one of their $120 jackets and the material was thin, not a solid black (which wasn’t mentioned), gets dusty easily, isn’t water-resistant despite being advertised as a rain coat, and the fit was so boxy! None of the model images on their website shows them wearing the jacket facing front so it was very misleading; it’s like Everlane purposely hides the shape and cut of their clothing with their imagery. I didn’t wear the jacket immediately so my return window was over and I had to deal with it. Second, I ordered their utility barrel pants in a size smaller than my usual. Turns out I needed 2 sizes smaller and wished I had bought multiple sizes to try as they charge $7 shipping unless you reach the minimum of $79 then $7 return too. Keep in mind, no part in my life was I ever a size 00 which was the size I had to reorder. I purchased 2 different colors of the same pants, same size. One of them ended up being smaller/bigger than the other and the lengths were also different. 1 out of 2 pants were final sale so I had to donate it. The pockets on the pants are also fast-fashion-tiny and cut in a weird impractical angle. I tried to leave bad reviews for both the jacket and pants and neither of them were approved to their website. For the prices Everlane charges, I would’ve expected better quality control, consistent sizing and better customer policies. Also, the $7 shipping in the USA was through DHL then USPS does the final delivery which pissed me off. They claim sustainability which I’m skeptical about but it’s nice they ship out in a paper mailer. However, if it’s raining and your item is sitting outside, beware. It will get wet. The pants were just thrown into a paper mailer and it was raining the day it was delivered so the mailer got drenched and the pants had wet spots on it. I knew Everlane since they started years ago but I don’t know if they were always like this. Too bad. So much for my goal of being “sustainable”.",3,2023-02-28 21:57:02+00:00,en,,Janet,US,,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=7,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=7

No. I've had $10 cotton tees and tanks from Old Navy that were ten times better and lasted for years without looking like an Everlane tank after one wash. The ankle boots I bought ? Also garbage. Five wearings and I had to throw them out. I can't comment on the flats I ordered as those were summarily cancelled by EVRLN without notice. Grateful to have saved the money. Thanks, Everlane.

This time I thought I’d order different items like trainers, workout outfits and standard tees (items that don’t really need tailored fit). The order for some reason was split into three despatches: 1. Trainers, shorts 2. White tee 3. Black tee. Looks like a very sustainable and environmentally friendly way of logistics. The trainers were shipped immediately followed by the black tee a week later HOWEVER, the black tee arrived first and when I checked on the trainers a month later, I found out that they were “lost in transit” and that they do not reship orders to Australia so my only option is a refund. My white tee is currently somewhere in the ether. As you can imagine, I was left very disappointed as I was hoping for a nice birthday gift to myself.

The returns process is very simple; I just had to pay €8 to get a return label and I got my money back very quickly for the items returned.

I ordered a white t-shirt that was over 3 times the price of the sort I would normally buy but horrible quality and see through. All the clothes felt poor quality and weren’t at all soft or comfortable to wear. I then discovered that all the clothes had been made in various different Asian countries (eco-friendly my a**). I really didn’t want to return them to fly these clothes yet again halfway round the world but the three items were so expensive I couldn’t afford to keep clothes I would never wear. Returning them was a whole other minefield and in the end took a month to get it sorted. I’m assuming it was partially due to the fact that we’re in national lockdown in the uk that they had not accounted for, and I had communicate back and forth with someone in the us. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone as the clothes are overpriced and poor quality.",1,2021-03-18 10:12:30+00:00,en,,Customer,GB,,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=13,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=13
6043a2c1f85d75064c397fb4,Nope,"Bought the oversized blazer with stripes, it arrived 20 minutes ago. I cannot seem to leave a review on their actual product, which has mainly 4 and 5 stars (I saw that they will send you a link after one month of making the purchase, so you have time to use the product and get an actual feel of it... or their products are so low quality that they are trying to avoid reviews to be left) . Now, those people leaving the reviews are either ""fashion gurus"" or, and am sorry to say, have no understanding of what good quality means. Firstly, my parcel arrived poorly packaged, the blazer was just placed in a box, no actual packaging inside. Normally this wouldn't pose a problem, but for the price I paid for it, £100 +, I would expect it arrives in somewhat pristine condition. It obviously did not, it was full of fluff, HAIRS FROM SOMEBODY ELSE, cardboard pieces and creased. This is received during a pandemic, but let's just omit this little detail... Also, they are hipped for their transparency, right? Giving us the price breakdown on their website. Well, the quality is a joke, I have blazers from zara which feel the same, and have similar garments. The photo is different from the product also, it looks darker and more ""heavy"" in the photo. I still like the actual blazer, but I think the price is waaaay to much(I got mine on sale though) and the packaging/ dirty product is a massive no no for me. I will never bother with this company again, and am now debating whether to send the product back. The only problem is I am in the UK and don't want the hassle... Would have left 2 or 3 stars, but am too disappointed with how the blazer was just ""thrown"" in the box and sent to me.",1,2021-03-06 15:41:53+00:00,en,,Alexandra,GB,,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=13,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=13

All the shirts — which were meant to be an oversized, loose-fit style — fit in the body but were squeezing my arms so tight I couldn’t move them properly. All the pants fit me in the legs but were gaping at my waist, far beyond what a belt could fix. I have fairly average proportions so this is very strange. I returned the items almost two months ago but I’m still waiting for the return to be processed. Everlane says it’s still in transit, but Australia post says it was delivered months ago, and given the quality of their garments I trust aus post far more than Everlane. Their returns policy was what made me feel comfortable ordering items — knowing I could be refunded if they didn’t fit. Extremely disappointing, especially given the company’s supposed reputation for more sustainable clothing. Nothing is sustainable about making poor quality, badly cut clothes and leaving your customers hundreds of dollars worse off for it.

I ordered for the first time around September this year. Everything was fine when I ordered and the shipment was confirmed with a tracking number. However, after 3-4 weeks I had noticed my shipment was stuck and the status had not updated for almost a week. So I contacted Everlane about the issue and received a response within the same day offering a replacement shipping. I rejected the offer as I had waited so long and did not want to go through another 3-4 weeks of delayed shipping. Some days later I received no response. I had to send a second email as the shipment had still not arrived. By this point it was more than a month of waiting. Thankfully I got a response a week later and a refund was processed. Overall, I honestly felt that I had been scammed. Everlane held my money for more than a month and failed to deliver my order. I only discovered after this ordeal that I'm not the only one facing the same experience. Also, FYI for Australian customers out there, as this is a US company the T&Cs exclude all liability for Everlane's products to be of merchantable quality. Although you pay GST in your order and the payment is made to some Australian-looking bank you lose all entitlement to Australian Consumer Guarantees.

""Move Along Now- Nothing to see here"" There is plenty to see here. I placed an order for boots in late October by the end of the first week in November I hadnt received anything but I was charged! I contacted customer service and the girl basically just said ""sorry there was a glitch they were out of stock."" (but they werent out of stock when i bought them and they werent out of stock when I communicated with this girl) And THEN she cancelled my order! She didnt even ask me if I still wanted the boots- she just took it upon herself to make the decision for me and- isnt this bad for Everlane's business? If there is a glitch in the system shouldnt they try to help the customer and get them what they wanted to buy? So I email her like 3 times asking if the boots were still available bcs they show as being available- and NO RESPONSE. So I buy them again and take a screen shot of the order and send it to her to verify that the order is placed- NO RESPONSE. For days- Im struggling to buy these boots all because this girl couldnt say, "" would you still like them? I can have them shipped to you today"" So then I contact customer service AGAIN and the other girl offers me 15% off (which what is that?) Even if you refer a friend you get $25 off. I ask to speak to her manager about this issue because I think i should be compensated for my time and stress with this issue and the manager Kendall, is so dismissive and ineffective- I just realized... this is why their customer service team is so terrible. She doesnt care about the customers either- she's setting the tone. So- buyer beware.

5ec0a0d225e5d20a8897c215,Ok experience as an Australian shopper,"Writing a review as an Australian online shopper, in case it helps anyone. Tips: make the most of the free shipping for your first order. Pay using PayPal so that you can be reimbursed for return shipping costs. There's a big difference between express and standard shipping. I qualified for free express shipping for my first order and it's amazing. My order was packed next business day and they shipped using DHL Express. Parcel loaded onto a plane over the weekend, and was delivered all up within 4 days. Faster than even domestic shipping via Australia Post. I qualified for free standard shipping for my second order. It took about 2.5 weeks to arrive. They took about 2-3 days to pack. It was shipped using DHL eCommerce and tracking shows that it goes to distribution centres, bundled into a container probably with numerous other orders, and then shipped using Australia Post for the last leg. So if you need your items soon, best to use express shipping. Returns are easy. You pay for and print the return label at home. It's sent to an APG warehouse in AU and only costs $12 (activate PayPal free return shipping before you order so that you can be reimbursed). Once it reaches APG, there doesn't seem to be a way to track further progress. So I have no idea when it will reach Everlane. Their website says even once they receive it, it takes 2-3 weeks for the refund to be processed. They sent an incorrect item for one of my orders. Website instructions say email customer service with photos. After a week, still no response. Will update this review when this gets finally resolved. EDIT: 3 weeks after I sent the email, all I got back was an automated email apologising them being overwhelmed with emails. Had to send back incorrect item at my own cost. With the garment measurements on the website and ability to search reviews of other people with same body measurements, you are likely to get the correct size. I ordered jeans, which are always a gamble. The material may be different to expectations. The quality seems good for the price, if you get items on sale. Otherwise seems a little expensive (maybe due to exchange rate).",3,2020-05-17 02:26:26+00:00,en,,Maya,AU,,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=19,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=19

5eb2fe2f25e5d20a888e85db,We owe thoughtful brands our patience during these times,"I've ordered from Everlane roughly 5 separate times, and I have never been disappointed with what I received. Anything that didn't quite fit the bill was returned without issue. I think it's important to highlight during this time, that all businesses are struggling with both shipping delays, changes in staffing, and cash flow in general. Even Nordstrom which is hailed as the queen of customer service, took over a month to process a return which resulted in a late fee on my card with them because they just didn't process it correctly. Frank and Oak, a long time favorite of mine, struggled to return a refund for about 5 weeks. These are unprecedented times, and what most people don't know, is that the biggest brands -- old navy, gap, kohl's, etc have the largest cash flows and more resiliency because they are so large and hoard cash. Smaller brands release cash flows more quickly into the economy which is exactly what we need right now. The retail environment is changing, and if we don't put our trust in these brands, we'll all be walking around with fast fashion as our only choice. Be thoughtful about spending money on things you know you'll love, and if something doesn't fit or feel right, return it on a credit (an option Everlane has immediately, before shipping the return even) towards something you do love.",5,2020-05-06 18:13:03+00:00,en,,Sam Tucker,US,,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=19,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=19

I have contacted them twice and told them to do the right thing and cancel the order because it is frivolous (they were having a sale). They refuse to cancel the order.

I recently purchased the ""Boss Mules"" because I thought they looked timeless and I was convinced they would last for years. I work in an office setting and these were a practical staple piece to add to my wardrobe. My first disappointment came when I scuffed the toe of one shoe. I assumed that like my husbands well made expensive shoes I would be able to polish it away. I was so upset to see that these were not repairable, the material chosen was not polish-able, it was just a leather overlay? I kept wearing them, intent on not buying new items and keeping my environmental footprint low. Until today, when on my way to a very important work meeting to my shock and horror the heel on my ""Boss Mule"" separated from the sole. After only 5 months of very light use they are completely destroyed. I looked completely disheveled, talk about a poor first impression. For a company who prides themselves on ethics this just feels wrong.

So overall I paid an extra 23$ in taxes, 15$ in shipping and 13$ in shipping it back which I have lost on them! That's over 50$ on nothing! At least they should announce on their website, neither taxes or shipping is refundable! I lost 2/3 of the price of the pants, on nothing.",2,2019-09-24 08:59:08+00:00,en,,Mille,DK,,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=21,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=21

5d511790f018690b5cdad115,Favourite brand turns to disappointment,"I've had a very positive experience with Everlane so far, but in my last order I bought sandals for 88 usd that are breaking down after 2 months of use. Customer service blames it on me and will only refund me half the price as store credit. So you send me a low quality item and only offer to give me store credit, so I can buy more low quality items? For a brand with the marketing you have, I wouldn't expect you to be only out for cheap profit. A week before they broke, I gave a 5-star review which I can't seem to change now - so I'll write it here. I've had way cheaper leather sandals that lasted me a couple of years with heavy wear. Pretty disappointed.",2,2019-08-12 07:38:56+00:00,en,,Virve,DK,,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=21,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=21
5d44ca8bf01869069cc7918a,"Mediocre, at best…","Everlane’s business model is what had me intrigued to purchase from the brand. I love the idea of being able to see just how much markup they place on their products and being able to choose what you pay for certain items. That being said, I don’t see myself purchasing from them in the future. I live in Australia and I had to split my purchase into two transactions because my order exceeded the “financial limit”. I’ve never heard of this before when ordering from the US and I honestly think it’s just a way for Everlane to cheap out on delivery insurance. My two orders combined came to just over $1000AUD. I (stupidly) assumed that because I had spent such a considerable amount for only five items that the quality would be exceptional. I was wrong - the items I received are of pretty mediocre quality. I ordered two of the “Clean Silk Relaxed Shirt” thinking they would make excellent work wardrobe staples. Sizing is true, possibly even slightly generous. The shirts were constructed well, I’ll give them that, however the silk was very sheer and not at all suitable to be worn on its own. At $98USD per shirt, I was expecting very luxurious fabric and sadly this silk just did not perform how I wanted it to. Back into the box to be returned! Next thing I purchased was the “Back-Slit Work Pant”. The material used for these glorified leggings is super stretchy but also quite durable; very comparable to a stretchy denim. I had one of my friends comment that they were very slimming. As I said though, they are vehemently not pants! They are leggings! They have no pockets (atrocious!), no lining, the elastic waistband is only tacked down on the top edge so occasionally it will roll up/down and become quite uncomfortable. For $50USD should have returned these too, but I liked the design so I have kept these. Sizing is true, and the leg length is nice and long and hits at my ankle (I’m 5’11”). Third item I purchased was the “Clean Silk Charmeuse Tie Neck Blouse”. This pretty little blouse will set you back $98USD, but unlike the relaxed shirts this one isn’t sheer at all! It is very beautiful on and I love the design - very flattering. On the model it looked to be a nice length, but on me it does look like it’s slightly cropped. I would say that to pay $60USD for this item would be reasonable. I kept this item. In my next order I purchased two pairs of shoes; the “Editor heel” for $165USD and the “Editor slingback” for $155USD. I absolutely LOVE the look of these shoes and would have been quite happy with the quality (don’t get me wrong, there’s definitely room for improvement) but sadly the fit is not true to size as it suggests on Everlane’s website. I found both pairs of shoes to be very narrow. I would have liked to exchange these for the next size up, but sadly Everlane do not manufacture shoes larger than an 11. Back into the box to be returned! The returns process seems quite straightforward if you’re just returning one package. They have a flat-rate shipping price of $12.95AUD with Australia Post which is fine. I emailed customer service to ask if I could return all of my unwanted items in just one box, and sadly I can’t. I will be paying two separate shipping fees for two boxes to be shipped to the same place - ridiculous. They seem very inflexible regarding this matter. Why can’t customer service create a return label that incorporates both of my orders for any reason other than sheer laziness? Knowing that the quality is not deserving of the high price they place on their items, returns are not free, and that customer service really don’t serve their customers, I will not purchase nor recommend Everlane again.",3,2019-08-02 23:43:07+00:00,en,,Georgia McLennan,AU,,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=21,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=21

I had ordered a dress which was on sale with very few sizes left at the time of purchase. I was so excited to get the dress because of the quality of Everlane products, but was slightly annoyed to find today that my order had been sent back to the sender without notification of arrival or resending. I messaged customer service, hoping to be able to get my dress which had now run out of my size, and Kyle saved the day.

5c02a9459d378000988439d6,"Good quality good service, awful online service and shipping","I purchased everlane this november 11th and it took them 15 working days to arrived at my place. It was fine except that I needed to exchange the size because it was too big. The quality was top notch and i really liked how it feels but it was just too big. I was just super dissappointed it took them so long to get it shipped even though they managed to closed any changes i wanted to make. Within a day of purchase, I asked the customer support to change the size from M to S but she said they cannot do anything after 2 hours of purchase which I think pretty inconvenience. The customer service was superb but the thing is, I got $10 coupon for my first time purchase and thats pretty much what makes me want to buy it in the first place. Now that it got refunded, i am $10 short, which i think is such a disadvantage. I am going to New York on december 13th so I thought I could pick up my jacket at their new york store since its going to be cold as heck but no, they said the warehouse has very limited option and the new york store is out of stock. I mean?? I have worked at retail store before and never thought this would be a problem. She said the only way to ensure I get my order is by ordering online? I bet you $1000 that its going to arrived at my place by January ( 2 months from now) instead of “4-10 business days” so hell, coming from Indonesia to New York without warm jacket, I guess die in the cold is the way to go or spend another $200 on top of $155 to buy another coat? Im no Kardashian dude, so thats not an option. I saved up to buy my very first jacket on everlane so I was really looking forward to it. I guess The misadventure of dissappointment from American companies continues...(see my other reviews) Overall, i have mixed feelings about this company. Customer service is good, quality is good, but other than that, dont buy things online. Just go straight to the store to get rid of the shipping hassle.",3,2018-12-01 15:31:17+00:00,en,,Virginia,US,,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=22,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=22
5bff45a19d37800a687d70a2,Hit or miss clothes with outstanding customer service,"I have purchased many items from everlane over the past few years. The quality is general very good for the price although the fit is very hit or miss. I've probably kept about a third or half of what I have ordered. I have also some issues with their shipping/fulfillment services lately, they sent the wrong jeans three times in a row. However what really stands out is their customer service. Every time I have had an issue with an order or an article of clothing (like a sweater that got a hole at a seam within a day of wear) they have given me the benefit of the doubt and resolved the issue quickly and considerately. This more than anything else is what keeps me coming back to the store. I don't mind taking a chance on individual items because I have confidence that returning them will be straightforward and easy. The only caveat to this is that I have noticed that their denim return policy has gotten stricter recently and their denim fit/comfort is all over the place so I would avoid jeans. I also wish they would be more size inclusive. Instead of coming out with so many new items all the time I wish they would focus on making larger sizes of their existing items or improving the fit and quality of those items.",4,2018-11-29 01:49:21+00:00,en,,Calla,US,,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=22,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/everlane.com?sort=recency&page=22

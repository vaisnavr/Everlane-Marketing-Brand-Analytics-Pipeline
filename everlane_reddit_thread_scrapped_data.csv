But I'm also kind of tired of bloggers who go whole hog into promo-ing a brand, making money and getting free merch from their readers only to do exactly this - diss the brand and move on to the next one (that gives them free stuff natch). She says Everlane is cult-y, but she was totally a member of pushing that for quite a bit of time (when it was clear their stuff kind of sucked) and now just gone basically all-in for Elizabeth Suzann...

drrdh4t,t1_drrbwqp,abnruby,"I think this is a really good point. In reality, Everlane sells basics. It's minimalist fashion and it's not really my deal but whatever. If you're a blogger, you're making money off of those affiliate links, ads, and from your sponsored posts. From the number of people who read your blog, a small percentage are going to click through, a smaller number are going to buy, and very few are going to buy twice. If the brand you're repping sells basics, that number dwindles further. You need something new. So now it'll be Elizabeth Suzann until that stops making money, and then we'll get another post about how you're ""breaking up"" with another an online retailer. It's also worth noting that you don't really need to publicly deride a brand you'd previously endorsed unless you need to direct those people to another brand. 

For me, I read about the intern thing before I knew anything about the brand and it completely soured me on them. The fact that their clothing doesn't do anything for me is a bonus because I don't need to feel conflicted or like I'm missing out.

That said, I can understand getting caught up with brands and getting sucked into the beautiful idea they sell you, wanting to buy nothing but X/Y/Z forever... Until the spell wears off and you see the things as what they are, just clothes.

It's a nice thought that you could get an entire wardrobe from a single store/brand, but in reality it's going to lock you into a certain style and once the magic's gone you'll be more prone to getting bored of your Everlane closet or whatever brand it was you invested in.

Also while I really dislike quite a lot of what Everlane does (creating free focus groups is the most recent and egregious thing that comes to mind), the quality is fine.

First, it's unfair to compare an $18 dollar tee-shirt to a $50 or $75 dollar tee-shirt. Of course there will most likely be differences in quality. Second, she mentions repeatedly that the fit wasn't correct in the shirts or in the shoes – why are you purchasing and keeping products that don't fit you? If you purchase a pair of shoes and those shoes are too narrow to wear comfortably, return them. Don't keep them and then complain that you're unable to wear them? I'm very tall, if I purchased a pair of pants that were too short, I would return them and buy a pair that actually fit me.

Their leather goods, including the shoes, are all very good quality, though I have issues with some of the design (like their obsession with that exaggerated pointed toe).

drrc7m2,t3_7m4juu,MuraKurLy,"Eh, it depends.  

Whether or not Everlane is ""fast fashion"" is just a semantic game that will never have a conclusive answer.  The fact is that Everlane produces, as you said, a limited minimalist line.  The problem is a limited minimalist line in of itself is a type of marketing towards a certain kind of person; exactly the millennial ""clean"", ""I dont need extra stuff (but I still want nice stuff)"" kind of marketing the OP was referring too.  It is a style driven by marketing and a certain kind of ethos; whether or not it is more insidious or more ""capitalist"", so to say, is another question, but to claim it is radically different than any other style out there is slightly intellectually dishonest.

All in all, I don't really care about Everlanes ethics; I don't expect them to produce radical transparency (or radical anything, really) at the retail pricepoint they ask for given what I know about the market structure of fashion.  Their stuff is alright, but the fits aren't particularly amazing nor are their fabrics awesome enough for me to justify spending my personal money on them.  At the end of the day, I don't mind spending a lot of money on clothes, but what you make had better justify the cost in terms of marketing (because handmade virgin wool/cashmere milled by a small family owned mill and made in a small factory somewhere in Ireland is totally marketing) or materials or construction or otherwise.

drrottu,t3_7m4juu,thelonelybaguette,"Quality wise, I'm not pleased. I fell into the Everlane black hole of praise on the blogosphere, but I'm finding that I don't enjoy my purchases several months down the line. I keep reading on FFA and blogs that Everlane items have held up well so I desperately clung onto hope.  I purchased two silk shirts earlier this year. They fit well except at the forearm area. The silk started ripping at the seams. I emailed CS and they sent me two new silk shirts once I put the old ones in the mail. Unfortunately, one of the new shirts is ripping at the forearm seams despite me sizing up. I strength train and practice yoga weekly so I don't exactly have swizzlestick arms but I'm not swole to the point where I should be hulking out of my clothes. I purchased two cotton shirts this year that have twisted seams. A linen tee from this summer doesn't seem to know what to do every time I wash it. I alternate between line drying and machine drying the damn thing because it doesn't hold its shape. I needed wool trousers for work and found that I paid a lot of money for unlined pants with so-so construction. Like wtf is up the hem serging thing on Everlane pants? My elastic waistband wool pants for grana (that have a cheaper retail price) are more thoughtfully constructed! Like...partial lining so that the damn pockets don't flap everywhere. Hems that seem...finished. The only Everlane purchase I truly love is the linen button down. It's my summer go-to and that's the only item that has held up well after several months of serious use.

The advertising irks me and the constant launches are ridiculous. They promote radical transparency and can't stop pushing out cheap cashmere sweaters. On the one hand, Everlane likes to tout radical transparency about markups and their ""clean"" denim factory while on the other hand going gung ho for cashmere while ignoring overgrazing in Mongolia. And on a very very superficial note, it irks me to hear bloggers repeat ""radical transparency"" over and over without providing much more detail.

drrod43,t3_7m4juu,lollieboo,"Their high waisted jeans are legit. And at a solid price point. I was ordering the old j brand Scarlett seven eights off eBay until I found them. 

That said, no matter the circumstances of the internship thing, it’s shitty. 

And I don’t know that I would wear much else from them because they’re SO minimalistic, but I wouldn’t want them to discontinue that, maybe just introduce a “complex” line or something with a little more “devil in the detail” stuff like funky helmut Lang cuts or rag & bone colors/patterns. 


Overall, I love the brand and have been raving to friends about the jeans. In fact, they’re the only jeans I packed for a week in Fargo with the in-laws.

drrh8y3,t3_7m4juu,[deleted],"I purchased most of what they made for the first 2 years and so have had many items of theirs for a long time. Their shoe quality is excellent, though the shoe design can make the uncomfortable. The tees and old cashmere are great. The new cashmere varies. The thin merino items are bad quality. The new silk items have held up for a while. The biggest deterrent for me is that the cuts just suck. They are made for 6 foot skinny models with 0 thought to how things fit on real women.

drsgeg7,t3_7m4juu,rekhiebaby,"It's hit or miss for me. I definitely regret some of my purchases (the jeans, the Oxford shoes, etc.) and I really love some items (sweaters, silk shirts, boots). I've always had great CS and recently visited the SF Lab to make a return. The woman who helped me was fab, I wish they sent me a survey so I could leave positive feedback for her.

My main gripe is that the size 11 shoes (boots are ok) are not really a size 11. Many fit like a 10 and I don't have wide feet. I also wish they would offer longer lengths in their dresses and move on from some of the boxier shapes. 

I tend to roll my eyes at a lot of their marketing and general attitude. As someone who grew up in the greater Bay Area and still lives here, they are techbro-y and remind me of why I don't spend much time in SF anymore.
